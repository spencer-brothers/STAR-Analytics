# Outline
Data Prep
  -variable transformations
  -feature engineering
  -handling of NAs
  -identify performance benchmark (majority class classifier)
  -normalization, standardization, upsampling, downsampling


Modeling Process
  -fit several different logistic regression models (default params and interaction terms)
  -test random forest and gradient boosting
  -Discuss the candidate models you considered
  -the process for selecting the best model
  -cross-validation procedures
  -hyperparameter tuning
  -ensemble models
  -feature engineering
  -hyperparameter tuning


Model Performance 
  -Describe the performance characteristics of your best model, including run time
  -What is the train set and test set performance? What is your Kaggle score?
